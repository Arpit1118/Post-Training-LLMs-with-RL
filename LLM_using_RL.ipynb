The process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where light energy is absorbed by the chlorophyll molecules in the thylakoid membranes. The absorbed light energy is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, which are released into the atmosphere as oxygen. The remaining hydrogen is used to produce glucose, which is the primary source of energy for the plant. The process of photosynthesis is a complex and energy-intensive process that requires a lot of energy to produce glucose, which is why plants are often referred to as the \"sun\" of the ecosystem.\n"

The process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where light energy is absorbed by the chlorophyll molecules in the thylakoid membranes. The absorbed light energy is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, which are released into the atmosphere as oxygen. The remaining hydrogen is used to produce glucose, which is the main source of energy for the plant. The process of photosynthesis is a complex and energy-intensive process that requires a lot of energy to produce glucose, which is why plants are often referred to as the \"sun\" of the ecosystem.\n",
